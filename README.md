# Chat App
this is the front end of chat app. i'm using react js. just using pure css for the styling. another library that i used is [socket io](https://socket.io/). this library providing a bi-directional communication between a client and a server. this library is very useful for making real-time applications. the main idea is the server will get the message that you write then server will push it to all other connected clients.

## How the app works ? 
i have deployed the app, checkout: <br/>
[chatapp-j20](https://chatapp-j20.herokuapp.com/)
<br/>
when you open the app, it will ask you to enter username and room. then you will see a chat box that you can write a message and view the message

the project is very simple, send the message and broadcast it to another clients that in the same room.
